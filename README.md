Responsive View Full Site
=========================

Sample code to illustrate how to implement the responsive "view full site" option I wrote about on Creative and Code ([http://creativeandcode.com/responsive-view-full-site/](http://creativeandcode.com/responsive-view-full-site/)).

Demo: [Responsive View Full Site Demo](http://creativeandcode.com/demos/responsive-view-full-site-update/)

### Requirements
- None

### Usage
1. Add the following code where you'd like your view buttons to be:
	
		<div class="rwd-display-options">
        	<span id="view-full" class="rwd-display-option">View Full Site</span>
    	</div>


2. Place the contents of `rwd-display.css` in your stylesheet. 
3. Include the `rwd-display.js` file *after* jQuery.

Feel free to change the button text! Be sure to change the text in the JavaScript as well.
